Visit the deployed site: [World History Quiz](https://ashley9368.github.io/History-Quiz/)

Test your world history knowledge, See how well you can do.

I've always had a passion for world history, so I decided to create a world history quiz. 
It's a fun and interactive way to learn about the past and test your knowledge. 
Plus, I’m sure there are many others out there who share this love for history and would enjoy a quiz like this too.

## User Experience (UX)

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to dive into an engaging history quiz website and expand my knowledge about world history in a fun way.
* I want the site to work smoothly on my device, whether I'm using a phone, tablet, or computer.
* I want the site to be easy to navigate, so I can find the information and quizzes quickly and effortlessly.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to keep returning to discover fresh questions and intriguing historical challenges that expand my knowledge of different eras and figures. I’m excited to see what new topics will be featured and to continually test my understanding of world history.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to come back often to explore new questions and learn more about different historical topics. I’m excited to keep improving my history knowledge with each visit.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have gone with the blue and light beige theme to give a nice clean look and feel to my website.

* I have used `#124E66` `#EAE7DC` & `#748D92`as the primary colours and white as the text colour `#ffffff` 
* I also used `Green` and `Red` for correct and incorrect colours for the answers

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for desktop using balsamiq.

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a history page, and a signup page, and a basic thank you page for those who sign up.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

  ![favicon](assets/images/favy.png)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.

#### The Home Page

The home page of Winstons Fan Club displays the sites name as a title in bold text, navbar imbeded links to sub pages. It also has links to the signup and explore more history.

The history page consists of more information about Winston Churchill at different stages in his life.

The signup page consists of a signup form to signup for daily emails about Churchill and the Club.

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. I would like to add an interactive timeline, to let visitors explore a more interactive approach to history.
2. I would like to make the home page more welcoming, And add more sub pages regarding specific important events in Churchill's life.
3. I'd like to add a custom cursor when you hover over buttons. 
4. I would like to add a video of one of Churchill's speeches.
5. I would also like a much better thank you page.

### Accessibility

I have included image-to-text to improve accessability for visually impaired visitors.

* All of the fonts used are part of the san serif font family to help those with dyslexia to read more clearly.
* I have used similar colours throughout the site to provide the same experience for colour blind users.

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to create wireframes.

* [Github](https://github.com/) - To save and store the files for the website.

* [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) - IDE used to create the site.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To import the fonts used on the website.

* [Google Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools) - To troubleshoot and test features, solve issues with responsiveness and styling.

* [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) To create favicon.

## Testing

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | I had an issue with responsiveness on pages of different devices because i had written the media queries wrong, I have fixed those issue by rewritting various code across all media queries |

### Known Bugs

* Known bug: Title - If you click left or right of the title on any page, it sends the user back to the homepage. I intend to fix this so that only clicking on the actual title text redirects the user to the homepage.

## Credits

### Code Used

* I used [Chat GPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) To help when i was unsure what elements to use, but never copied direct code from Chat GPT, For example, I used ChatGTP to suggest various types of fonts which would be easy to read for people with dyslexia, and if i had got stuck on something i would ask which code i was missing or how can i achieve x.

* I used [Code Institute love running project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LRFX101+4/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/1da6ad13213740f1855a51d30a2375b1/) As refrence at times to adhere to good coding practice, The code that i have copied at any point has be mentioned with a comment in my code.

### Content

Except where mentioned content was created by me, except for images which were found on google, and historical facts that were generated from Chat GPT.
